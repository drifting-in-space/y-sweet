# y-sweet: a Yjs server with persistence and auth

**y-sweet** is an open-source server for building realtime applications on top of the [Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs) CRDT library.

## Features

- Persists document data to a network filesystem or S3-compatible storage, [inspired by Figmaâ€™s infrastructure](https://digest.browsertech.com/archive/browsertech-digest-figma-is-a-file-editor/).
- Scales horizontally with a [session backend](https://driftingin.space/posts/session-lived-application-backends) model.
- Deploys as a native Linux process, or as a WebAssembly module on Cloudflare's edge.
- Provides document-level access control via client tokens.
- Written in Rust with a focus on stability and performance, building on the excellent [y-crdt](https://github.com/y-crdt/y-crdt/) library.

## y-sweet stack

The y-sweet server can be used by any Yjs app, or you can use our opinionated stack to integrate Yjs and y-sweet into a Next.js app.

- `@y-sweet/sdk`, a TypeScript library for interacting with `y-sweet-server` from your application backend.
- `@y-sweet/react`, a React hooks library for building Yjs applications.
- A debugger for exploring Yjs document and presence state (WIP).

The goal of the y-sweet stack is to give developers the end-to-end developer ergonomics they would expect from a proprietary state-sync platform, **without the lock-in**.

y-sweet is MIT-licensed, and was created by [Drifting in Space](https://driftingin.space).
